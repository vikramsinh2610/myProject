# vue-template - Breadcrumb apporach

Hi, everyone! ðŸ‘‹

This is a nice repo with some approaches to use in VueJS (2.x) projects. [You may find more here](https://github.com/open-ish/vue2-template) or change by the branch at GitHub.

If you wanna, let's get in touch!

## What're we gonna use?

- [VueJS (2.x | 3.x)](https://vuejs.org/)
- [VueRouter](https://router.vuejs.org/)

## Summary

1. [Approach 1 - Using finders field at router config ðŸš€](#Approach-1---finders-field) - `The best one ðŸŽ‰`!
2. [Pre-requirements](#Installation)

## Approach 1 - finders field

At this approach, the idea is to create keys (which will be found at `finders array`) at route config and treat it in breadcrumb component itself. Here we'll use the join between `this.$route` (route instance) with finders keys.

In other words, the developer will only add `finders array into each router, files inside /router, and they will be used for the Breadcrumb component.  The best practice will be to put the breadcrumb validator into a helper file.
